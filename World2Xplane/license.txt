This release is intended for testing only, and may contain errors, or fail to generate a particular area. Please report bugs either via this site, or on the x-pilot thread.

By downloading and using this software, you agree to the following very simple license designed to protect the program, OpenStreetMap data and the 3D models which people (including myself) have worked very hard to create:

- You are free to use the program and distribute any scenery created, provided:
-- a) You also distribute the scenery and models generated by World2XPlane for free. Usage in commercial software is prohibited.
-- b) You do not redistribute World2XPlane unless explicit permission has been given.
-- c) Unless using other sources, you should attribute the scenery created to OpenStreetMap and World2XPlane.
-- d) You accept that I do not accept responsiblity if this application causes damage to your computer, sanity and/or your X-Plane installation.

Please read the manual carefully, as the current alpha release requires memory allocating, and a Java runtime setting up. Linux users can run the provided shell scripts, which will automate the startup, Windows users should edit the .bat file, and Mac OS X users should run via the command-line the first time to allocate memory. N.B. The utility can only accept PBF files, please consult the manual on how to obtain and convert these.
