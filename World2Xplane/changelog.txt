v0.7.4 (04/10/2015)
- Fixed bug with clipping to areas which was clipping to the incorrect zones in some cases
- Improved accuracy of buffer call. The exact distance in meters will be respected
- Fixed issue parsing heights which have a space in them
- Permanently disabled the obstacle lights.
- Removed rules to use default XP10 objects for industrial buildings as they were causing compatibility issues
- Fixed rule in config-hd.xml which would hide certain powerlines
- Removed rule which generated tracks as roads

v0.7.2 (14/04/2015)
- Minor bug fix for database library which caused local storage mode not to work

v0.7.1 (01/04/2015)
- Fixed bug with forest clipping around airports which causes a hang on certain large forests
- Fixed resume bug introduced in 0.7.0
- Updated the obstacle light generator to use DSF object elevations instead of custom objects
- Fixed issue which causes some OSM 3D objects to not be visible (TV tower in Munich)
- Removed OSM3D object generation for objects which only have a colour. This was causing huge loading times in places like Germany
  This change will mean OSM3D buildings will look more generic and lack the defined colour in OSM, but the scenery will load much quicker and will perform better

v0.7.0 (25/03/2015)
- Reprojected UK counties regions to WGS84.
- Fixed region bug when using smaller regions which aren't being picked up (UK and Germany regions now work)
- Fixed bug with clipping perimeter forests and fences so that inner polygons aren't clipped and causes lines of shrubs which don't exist in OSM
- Fixed collision detection issue where under certain cases items were never being placed
- Fixed bug with power lines which includes mixed types of towers and poles
- Fixed missing region code for France
- Improved speed of collision detection on line rules when using placement tracking
- Added beach .bch exclusions to the config file to make photoscenery look better
- Fixed double-backing roads when creating bridges over water
- Added best fit type rules for facades, taking height, area, etc into consideration. Added a few rules for highrise buildings and industrial
- Reduced default number of cores to 2, as higher was causing OOM
- Added sea nav lights from OpenSeaMap.
- Replaced electric pylons with custom pylons which respect pole/tower position in OSM and also have a small obstacle light
- Added "clip-to-area" for Line Rules, which if used with an area rule in the filter, will clip the line to the area,
  (e.g) Roads inside a caravan park will be clipped to the area tagged in OSM and then caravans placed along the road

v0.6.0 Beta (11/11/2014)
- Collision Detection for Line Rules (Set "collision-test" to true)
- Added tracking for Line Rules so placed objects can be tracked for collision detection (Warning, slow!!)
- Fixed placement bug on line rules which placed items too sparsely
- Fixed bug on Line Rules which ignored lines with only 2 points
- Fixed serious bug which excluded certain tiles from being generated for larger countries
- Added "angle-from-road" to object rules which will try and rotate an object to align with a neighbouring road, e.g. bus-stops
- Added groups for objects in line rules using group ID. Random groups can be used to group similar buildings
- Added width and spacing object for objects in line rules
- Added "spacing-division" to line rules, so when using double-sided offsets with object distances
- Fixed bug with random rule placement and the density ranges (Which was placing too many trees)
- Fixed bug where objects lacking regions in CSV files where completely ignored and never used.
- Added "polygon" rule, which works similar to facades, e.g. For placing beaches, gravel, grass textures
- Added improved shrub/hedgerows to the default rule (.for inside world-models)
- Aligned tractors on farms to the edge of the field (so tractor seems to be following a path)
- Added "count" option to line rule to place a set "count" of objects at random along the line, e.g. Place a tractor somewhere on a farm track
- Aligned/Rotated road signs, bus-stops, billboards, churches, windmills to the nearest road
((For an example of the autogen options, have a look at the commented out section "autogen" in config-hd.xml)


v0.5.1 Beta (04/07/2014)
- IMPORTANT!!! World2XPlane now reads the csv files from world-models. You either need to set an X-Plane folder location in the GUI
  or set the world-models-folder config option in the config file
- Fixed parsing of outer ways on a relation where some members might have different tags
- Fixed the usage of multi part outer ways for area trackers
- Excluded inner areas on multi polygons when used in random rules
- Added min-height/max-height option to rules. Objects not in the specified range will be ignored and passed on.
  (This is easier than using the filter options, as people specify heights using various units and fields)
- Added rule for placing a silo on some farmyards
- Tweaked the adaptive height rule so it only effects cities. Towns looked too unrealistic, but works well in cities
- Fixed threading issue
- Updated clipping rules for airports to include runways, taxiways
- Added Priority to regions, so it's possible to have US (country), and then states, and the states will take priority.
  Ordered is determined by how they are listed in the CSV file, e.g. US;AZ will match all US buildings and Arizona, but will give Arizona
  Priority
- Added support for US states as a region

v0.5.0 Beta (05/06/2014)
- Added "building" option to facades (defaults to true). When false, such objects are excluded from collision detection, e.g. fences
- Added "required-level" to all rules so that the object-density setting inside X-Plane can be set per rule
- Set multipolygon and generated objects to always show, so they don't get broken up by X-Plane on lower density settings
- Updated config files with required-levels, e.g. Wind Turbines have higher density settings than small houses
- Renamed <closed> option on facades to allow-unclosed. Set this to true if the facade should also wrap an unclosed way, e.g. a Fence
- Fixed bug when drawing unclosed lines as facades
- Fixed bug which caused airports to be clipped incorrectly
- Fixed stats error on Windows, where stats file where not being written
- Added "skip-last-point" option for facades, so the default option of skipping the last point when drawing facades can be overridden (For rendering fences correctly)
- Added piers
- Added new industrial building set

v0.4.1a Beta (11/05/2014)
 - Fixed hung thread problem
 - Fixed rotation problem on some buildings
 - Excluded inner areas on multi polygons when used in random rules

v0.4.0 Beta (10/05/2014)
 - Command-line interface (See manual)
 - New GUI front-end, with progress window more suitable for multiprocessing.
 - Added reject-multi-polygon option to object rules to reject multi-polygon buildings
 - Configurable processors through the GUI, will override option in config file.
 - Added "simplify" option, with a tolerance value. Shapes will be simplified using the tolerance value in metres. Simplified most facades, forests and vectors for performance
 - Fixed bug which caused lots of empty tiles to be processed unnecessarily
 - Prevented a DSF file from being created when empty
 - Added facade roof height option, so some space is allocated for the roof
 - Added node trackers for tracking items like churches, petrol stations, etc.
 - Added adaptive heights. These are use to set the height of an unknown object based on its distance from a tracked node
 - Added new rule to set objects in towns, village and city centres to a specified height range. So random height placement is a bit more realistic
 - Added option to detect which side of a building contains the road, and to use an appropriate model so the door faces the road (Slows down generation a lot)
 - Added option to use .poly file for creating boundary exclusions. If passed in, this will be used to generate exclusion zones per 1x1 degree tile.
   If using smart exclusions, this option will still be used to generate road exclusions.
 - Fixed memory leak and optimised some parts of the application

v0.3.1 Beta (16/04/2014)
- Multi threading support. If set in the config file, more than one processing thread will be used. Tweak this value based on your memory and CPU
- Fixed bug in road generation with ID allocation, which caused a crash in certain OSM areas
- Option to set the location of temporary files "temporary-file-path"
- Option to configure the number of items in a building exclusion per grid "buildings-per-grid"
- Added Blacky's new building set, over 300 small buildings between 5x5 to 11x11
- Added "buffer" option to thicken/thin ways, or turn a line into a polygon. e.g. To place a forest around a stream or pond
- Reverted to the OSM2XP facade set by default (Some texture issues with the Simheaven set, which need to be resolved)
- Allowed local resource objects to be rewritten with a min_height. See rules for adding flags and antennas on top of buildings
- Increased resolution on country recognition, as regions weren't working close to the coast

v0.3.0 Beta (10/04/2014)
- Roads, Powerlines and Railways can now be generated as part of the scenery (Experimental)
- Added network exclusions
- Large library update with generic Western European buildings from Uwespeed, and some noise, e.g. cars, farm equipment
- Added way trackers (e.g. To track ways such as power lines, chair lifts and place pylons)
- Added angle-from-way to object rules (used with way trackers)
- Added default rules for aerialways (gondolas, ski-lifts) - (Disabled until release of X-Plane 10.30)
- Added street lights along roads (Doesn't always work correctly as we don't know the size of the road)
- Added shape restriction option for object best fit rules. Currently on SQ for Square is used.
- Allowed rules to be randomised using an identifiable random seed (see manual)
- Randomised the farm rules to place hay bales or farm equipment, but never together
- Collision detection now includes roads
- Configuration option to cut/trim back forests/farmland if a road shares a perimeter or cuts through the middle. This will remove trees from the roads when the forest hasn't been
  split inside OSM, or is sharing a perimeter with the road.
- Support for man_made=cutline for splitting forests (as part of road cutting)
- Option to cut out forests/fields from airports (Buildings need to be handled seperately).
- Added closed option to facades, so unclosed fences and walls can be rendered if set to false. Don't use this with buildings
- Configured memory allocation on Windows to use as much memory as possible (from the .exe file)
- Added libraries (So items in CSV files can be grouped) and entire libraries disabled/enabled

v0.2.0 Beta  (22/03/2014)
- Support for multiple facade sets
- Added distribution rules for facades, (i.e. Choose the percentage of items taken from one or the other facade set, e.g. To make more dark roofs appear in Germany)
- Allowed exclusions to be switched on or off completely
- Fixed/Optimised the algorithm for repairing self-intersecting ways. It now doesn't get upset trying to generate some of the huge mountain forests in Japan.
- Fixed small typo in the config file which ignored certain wind farms.
- Reworked smart exclusions to be much faster and also far more accurate. (Now enabled by default)
- Added Simheaven's Facade set
- Allowed random rules to fall back to placing .for files when tile is empty.
- Moved all world-models objects into a library, so they're no longer part of the scenery
- Indicated when the app runs out of memory, and advices what to do
- Reduced memory usage (PACA France should now generate with 4GB)
- Added progress bar and note in log window when generation has finished
- Changed label for memory usage to change colours and also show percentage.
- Modified pool allocation for DSFTool, "busy" tiles will now generate without crashing out
- Used church best fit rules to place churches.
- Added some more darker roofed buildings
- Added another radio mast seen commonly in Russia
- Fixed bug with building parts and flat roofs, where the roof was sometimes invisible (and caused rendering problems in Rostock, Germany)
- Lightened the colours for building parts so they look less like lego bricks
- More flicker reduction (If you still see buildings flicker (and some still do), please check why in OSM before reporting a bug)
- Showed the location of the output file upon scenery generation completion
- Showed max memory usage at the end of generation
- Added debug option in config file to produce images of exclusion zones (saved into the DSF File location)

v0.1.1 Beta  (12/03/2014)
- Added Hard Limit on random objects (default 700000) per tile, as a higher value can crash DSFTool. (Use random-placement-limit to configure)

v0.1.0 Beta (10/03/2014)
- Added self-configuring Windows exe files which should assign itself the correct amount of memory and run without any editing of files
- Forced DDS generation during building part generation and removed PNG files and debug files to save space
- Threaded DDS generation during part generation
- Disabled generation of parts when a simple facade can be used instead
- Ignored routing and other relation types that aren't used, so that they don't need to be processed or checked for tags. Should reduce memory usage and increase processing speed
- If a 3D object is all one colour, then share a texture, reducing the number of textures generated
- Fixed normals on domed and flat roofs.
- Lowered default density of cattle and farm equipment on fields as the value was too high and looked odd in some areas
- Added min-area, max-area to random rules, as the huge residential zones in France were causing DSFTool to crash.
- Limited trees inside residential areas to smaller areas. Larger areas have far less trees
- Placed limit on random rules for farmland, larger farm areas won't receive any random objects (Corine data in France does not split farms up)
- Disabled coordinate compression on local storage mode, as it was causing some polygons to self-intersect due to precision errors. The database files are now much bigger,
  12GB is required to generate France, but less errors will appear during generation.
- Support for more rare colours names added.
- Support for specifying different densities for different areas inside random rules (using low density values on large areas can kill X-Plane and DSFTool)
- Added default rule to place lorries/trucks into car parks in industrial areas
- Added default rules to place monuments/landmarks
- Added default rules for adding radio towers/obstacles
- Large library update for buildings


v0.0.6 Alpha 09/03/2014
- Fixed serious bug when there are more than 32,768 object definitions shared via DSF. Tile generated local objects are now treated seperately

v0.0.5 Alpha 08/03/2014
- Added building-exclusion-range and forest-exclusion-range to configure the size of the exclusion zones.
  Decreasing this value can seriously slow down generation, so use with caution
- Flipped order of residential/industrial rules to prevent untagged towns from appearing as entirely industrial
- Fixed a problem which caused Spain to fail to generate due to some very corrupt multipolygons from imported Corine data.
- Fixed huge domed roofs on some buildings when there was no roof height given in OSM


v0.0.4 Alpha 06/03/2014
- Support for OSM3D tags and building relations http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Simple_3D_Buildings. The rules are followed strictly, so please read.
- Added tolerance option to object best-fit rules. The default is 1 metre. Increasing the tolerance will increase the number of buildings, but the buildings
  may not match or be too big for the area they are being inserted into. A tolerance of ~1 meter works for houses, and for industrial and agriculture,
  a higher value of 2 seems to work. Please experiment with this option if you notice too few buildings or buildings colliding into each other.
- Updated best-fit placement to prefer objects that match the specified height.
- Added default height for objects in best-fit with no height. This value is used to set a maximum height limit on objects with no height when using best-fit rules
- Added configurable regions (See documentation for details)
- Culled unused faces on OSM 3D models for performance
- Added Linux startup scripts (for configuring memory) - Thank you Crashmax for writing and testing these.
- Added domed and onion roofs for OSM 3D models
- Respected the OSM rules regarding 3D building relations, i.e. If they contain a building part, the outline isn't rendered. Should prevent some flickering
- Added compress-textures option to the config, which when enabled, will attempt to compress all textures from the local library to DDS.
- Collision test when a building is in more than one relation, to ensure the building isn't added twice. Will reduce flickering facades
- Library update, there are now much more regional buildings for Italy, Switzerland and Eastern Europe.
- Added "region" option for all rules, so rules can be applied only to specific regions. Added a sample of changing the trees in Spain.
- Allowed files to be included into the configuration file so that large sections can be separated.
- Fixed several bugs related to the filter rules ignoring things it shouldn't have

v0.0.3 Alpha
- Fixed an X-Plane crash caused by facades with negative heights
- Disabled (temporarily) custom facades for buildings over 400 metres, as on certain height combinations over this value, X-Plane just crashes for an unknown reason.
  Changing the "SCALE" value in the custom facade prevents the crash, but then messes up the texture.
- Renamed min-height, max-height in config file to min-random-height, max-random-height
- Removed LIT textures from facades (as they aren't yet implemented)
- Removed some rules out of the config file, e.g. Placing stop-signs and fences (as they only hurt frame-rate and aren't visible above a few feet)
- Fixed error reported on Windows when the GUI won't open because it can't find the X-Plane folder.
- Added restrict-height option to object rules to enforce the height limit inside the CSV

v0.0.2 Alpha
- Added "determine" option to random rules, which when specified, the angle of the outer way will be guessed. e.g. Cars in a car park can be aligned to the largest wall.
- Made generated facades much smaller, which reduces the generated scenery size
- Fixed the circular rule which was being too strict. Some rounded objects weren't being detected as round as the tolerance was too low.
- Made the tank facade all white, so it tanks look more realistic
- Updated default config to prefer hedgerows around farms rather than larger trees
- Changed the name of building rules to facade rules, to prevent confusion with object rules
- Fixed path bug which required OSM files to end in .osm.pbf
- Reduced memory usage by about 30% when not using local storage
- Fixed color code parsing to pick up base color types
- Added better error messages, providing a link to the problematic way
- Fixed number formatting problem on the German locale for Windows when writing facades (Caused facades to go high into the sky)
- Fixed DSFTool path on Linux

v0.0.1 Alpha
-Initial Release
